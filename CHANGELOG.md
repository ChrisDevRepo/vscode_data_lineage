# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - optimization branch

### Added
- **Dynamic AI Model Resolution** — `@lineage` now verifies model registration via `vscode.lm.selectChatModels` at the start of every session. This resolves "Chat provider not registered" errors (common in Copilot Free) by dynamically mapping the user's selection to an officially registered provider instance.
- **Preserved Conversation History** — Removed active context eviction. History is now 100% preserved regardless of length. Token budget monitoring is purely informational (logged to Debug), ensuring the assistant never "forgets" previous turns due to incorrect model limits.
- **"Show full description" chip** — after every `@lineage` response that produced a graph view, a second chat chip renders the full AI description 1:1 inline. No re-analysis, no extra LM call — the description is captured when the view is created and replayed verbatim on click. Complements the existing "Detailed explanation (N)" chip (which extends the scope via deferred questions).
- **Metadata band above sections** — every `present_result` description now starts with an `**In:** … / **Out:** … / **Loading Pattern:** …` banner between the intro and the first section. In/Out are direct graph neighbors of the origin (object-level, not column-level). Loading Pattern is AI-inferred and only appears when the origin is a stored procedure — views and UDFs skip the line. Empty neighbor sets render as `(none — root node)` / `(none — terminal node)`.
- **Per-section object table** — when a section groups two or more nodes under one label, the render layer prepends a `| Object | In | Out |` table showing each node's direct graph neighbors. Clarifies variant-sibling families at a glance. Single-object sections skip the table — redundant with the badge + section title.
- **Technical subsection (classification-driven)** — when the session is classified as `technical` or `both`, each `present_result` section includes a `#### Technical` block: SQL code snippets (not full statements), LaTeX formulas, variant delta-mode wording, performance observations (Hash/Nested Loop joins, Cartesian warnings, DISTINCT/OR antipatterns, distribution hints). NO NEW FACTS — archive stays the sole evidence. Column I/O tables, nullability/precision prose, and full SQL statements remain out of scope.
- **Mission-type classification gate** — at the active→synthesis transition `@lineage` infers the mission type (`business` | `technical` | `both`) from the user's question and mission brief. Inline mode streams a one-line banner (`> Starting analyze phase — <kind>-driven.`); SM mode folds the signal into the existing `confirm_sm_start` messaging. No chip, no user override — re-ask the question for a different angle.
- **YAML-driven capture rules** — `aiOutputTemplates.yaml` now drives both what the AI writes into `detail_analysis` per hop (capture phase) AND how the final present_result document renders (synthesis phase). Four new keys split the work by phase: `business_capture` + `technical_capture` fire at the active hop loop (capture rules); `business_subsection` + `technical_subsection` fire at synthesis (render rules). Users edit the YAML to change either what gets archived or how it gets rendered; edits to capture keys flow end-to-end because the archive is the sole evidence at synthesis. `BLOCK.writeFindings` in `smPrompts.ts` slimmed to engine invariants only (archive is sole evidence, NO NEW FACTS, mission_brief anchor, pass/irrelevant verdict shortcuts). Content rules (formulas, column renames, SQL snippets, DDL observations, join types, antipatterns, distribution hints) moved to the YAML capture keys.

### Changed
- **Deferred follow-ups now fire for NL-filtered dependencies** — when the user's question included an NL filter like `ignore UDFs and views`, `@lineage` was silently dropping references to out-of-scope objects instead of deferring them. The "Detailed explanation (N)" chip consequently stayed hidden. `@lineage` now still won't *analyze* filter violators, but if one is a meaningful dependency for the mission it lists it as a deferred follow-up the user can click to review.
- **Cancellation-aware chat handler** — pressing Stop (or starting a new prompt mid-answer) no longer produces a red `*Error: Response stream has been closed*` bubble in chat. The handler observes VS Code's cancellation signal, exits cleanly as a typed `cancelled` state, and logs a single `Chat response cancelled by user` line instead of escalating to an error. Same behavior when VS Code tears the stream down for any other reason (host reload, etc.).

### Fixed
- **AI Tool Registry Compliance** — fixed a regression where the AI model would fast-fail (0 tokens) on `/search` and `/trace` commands. Per VS Code API standards, `vscode.lm.tools` are now explicitly mapped to `vscode.LanguageModelChatTool` instances before being passed to the model.
- **Context Preservation in Hop-by-Hop mode** — fixed a bug where the `HistoryManager` would aggressively compact `action_required` envelopes. This ensures the vital `hop_context` for the first node is preserved across the chat boundary, preventing AI tool hallucinations at the start of an exploration.
- **Active Phase Tool Surface Alignment** — expanded the active phase tool list to include `lineage_get_ddl_batch`. This allows the AI to fulfill the system prompt mandate of resolving truncated DDLs during autonomous exploration.
- **Deterministic Command Execution** — enforced `Required` tool mode for `/search` and `/trace` commands to prevent models from returning empty responses instead of invoking the requested lineage tools.

### Documentation
- **Two-mode contract documented** — `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs-internal/AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, and `README.md` now clearly describe the split between inline mode (small scope, AI decides completion via `complete: true`, per-route yes/no when stepping outside your filter schemas) and hop-by-hop SM mode (large scope, user-approved upfront with `confirm_sm_start`, closed-loop with deferred follow-up chips at synthesis). No behavior change — the contract was already in the code since 0.9.9; docs caught up.

### Internal
- `src/ai/chatResponseWriter.ts` — new `ChatResponseWriter` class owns the `ChatResponseStream` + `CancellationToken` lifecycle; encapsulates `open | cancelled | closed` states as a discriminated union; every `stream.markdown / progress / button` call in `lineageParticipant.ts` routes through it. `HopLoopExit` extended with a first-class `cancelled` variant so `dispatchExit` handles user-cancel via exhaustive switch, not caught exceptions.
- `AiSession.lastPresentResultDescription` — stores the last successful present_result description for the "Show full description" chip. Cleared on `resetExploration()`.
- `AiSession.classification` — mission-type field (`business | technical | both`), Zod-validated at `setClassification()`. Cleared on `resetExploration()`.
- `src/ai/templateRenderer.ts` — graph-topology projection helpers (`renderMetadataBand`, `renderSectionObjectTable`, `shouldEmitLoadingPattern`). Pure projection; no content decisions.
- `src/ai/classification.ts` — `ClassificationSchema` (Zod enum), `inferClassificationFromText()` heuristic, `CLASSIFICATION_BANNER` text lookup.
- Five new `aiOutputTemplates.yaml` keys: `loading_pattern`, `business_capture`, `business_subsection`, `technical_capture`, `technical_subsection` — phase-pure instruction blocks. `*_capture` ship at ACTIVE (capture rules); `*_subsection` ship at SYNTHESIS (render rules). Each key declares its `stages:` list as informational; canonical routing lives in `STAGE_BY_KEY` in `src/ai/templateRenderer.ts`. Overlays that contradict canonical routing are logged and ignored; fallback on malformed user YAML shows a VS Code notification and reverts to shipped defaults.
- Branch workflow — `restore-0.9.8-quality` frozen on remote as `baseline1`; `optimization` forked from it for ongoing work.
- Local-only dev tool: `.claude/skills/iteration-review/SKILL.md` — automates the UAT baseline-vs-iteration comparison (content quality first, tokens/duration second). Not shipped (`.claude/` is gitignored).

## [0.9.9] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Scope budget + consent gate** — Before long explorations, `@lineage` surfaces the planned scope (nodes, schemas, depth) and asks for confirmation. Reply `yes` to proceed, `no` to pause, or ask a different question to redirect.
- **Natural-language depth handling** — "direct neighbors", "one level", or explicit type filters ("ignore UDFs and views") are honored structurally at the engine level, not just as prose hints.
- **Mission briefing** — When exploration starts, `@lineage` writes a short plan (intent, scope, filters) that survives context wipes on long multi-hop sessions.
- **Deferred follow-ups** — When `@lineage` encounters references outside the approved scope, it surfaces them as clickable follow-up chips below the response. One click investigates the specific object.
- **Incremental AI view updates** — Ask the AI to add or remove specific tables in an existing view without restarting the analysis.

### Changed
- **Modernized logging engine** — OOP architecture; preserves all existing diagnostics.
- **Modular extension bridge** — UI-bridge logic decomposed into specialized modules for easier maintenance.
- **AI session management** — 30-minute session timeout with automatic cleanup; starting a new exploration while a previous one runs discards the old findings with an in-chat notice (no blocking dialogs).

- **`@lineage` AI assistant** — Ask questions about your graph in GitHub Copilot Chat (`@lineage what depends on Sales.Order?`, `@lineage trace upstream from dbo.FactSales`). Requires GitHub Copilot and VS Code 1.95+.
- **AI output templates** — Customize how `@lineage` formats summary, description, badges, highlights, and notes via `dataLineageViz.ai.outputTemplateFile`. Scaffold with Command Palette → *Create AI Output Templates*. See [AI Prompts Guide](docs/AI_PROMPTS.md).
- **Primary key badges** — PK columns are flagged in the table detail view. Composite keys show ordinals (PK1, PK2, …).
- **Platform detection** — The extension identifies SQL Server, Azure SQL, Fabric, and Synapse from both dacpac files and live connections.

### Changed
