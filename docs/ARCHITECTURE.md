# Architecture

The `@lineage` participant uses a **Map & Router** pattern: the extension host owns topological authority and termination; the language model owns semantic per-node analysis. This document maps that contract to source files. For the YAML knobs that shape AI output, see [`AI_PROMPTS.md`](AI_PROMPTS.md). For build / ingestion / IPC reference, see [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

## End-to-end journey

One turn of a `@lineage` question. The diagram encodes **ownership** (who terminates each step) by colour, **node role** (decision / gate / activity / terminator) by shape — UML activity-diagram conventions.

Legend (border colour only — interior follows light/dark theme): purple = user-driven · blue = AI-driven · orange = engine-driven · green dashed = terminator. Termination authority is therefore: AI in Discovery / Inline / Synthesis, Engine in SM hop loop and the consent gate.

| Phase | Owner | Behaviour |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | AI | Searches the catalog and classifies the question. **Class D** = single object or graph-wide metadata, answered directly. **Class S** = relationships spanning ≥2 connected objects, hands off to the engine via `start_exploration`. |
| **Gate** | Engine | Emits `action_required: confirm_sm_start` for every Class-S exploration. Renders the BFS scope rooted at the origin as a hop-distance tree (origin → hop 1 → hop 2…) plus a "How I read your prompt" banner showing the NL extractor's parsed identifiers, with three buttons: **Approve & Proceed**, **Refine scope**, **Cancel**. Detail markdown comes from `ScopeContract` via `gateDetailRenderer`. Always re-rendered when the session is `awaiting_gate` at finalizer time — even when the AI narrates without re-calling `start_exploration`. Mode (Inline / Sliding-Memory) is decided at lock-in based on the post-filter scope size + DDL cost (≤10 nodes ∧ ≤10k tokens → Inline) — refining can flip the mode. |
| **Refine loop** | AI + Engine | While the gate is pending, free-text user replies are routed to the AI as scope-refinement intent. The AI translates natural language ("ignore the staging schema", "drop views", "trace TotalRevenue") into a full re-spec on `lineage_start_exploration` — `excludeTypes` / `excludeSchemas` / `excludeNodeIds` / `passNodeIds` / `forceMode` / `classification` / `targetColumns`. **NL-named exclusions must use `excludeNodeIds`, not `excludeTypes`.** The NL extractor surfaces the parsed identifiers in the gate banner so over-generalisation is visible before approval; mismatch (named identifiers + `excludeTypes`) rejects with `nl_filter_overgeneralized`. Engine re-runs BFS, rebuilds the `ScopeContract`, and re-emits the gate. Loop until Approve or Cancel. |
| **Inline run** | AI | One-shot analysis; AI sees the full scope's DDL at once and self-terminates with `complete: true`. |
| **SM hop loop** | Engine | Hop-by-hop drain of the agenda. Memory wipes each hop. AI's `complete: true` is silently ignored — the engine emits the synthesis trigger when the agenda is empty. |
| **Synthesis** | AI | Lifts the full Detail Archive and authors the final report via `present_result`. |
| **Completed** | User | Holds the result graph. Follow-up edits/prunes re-render in place; `supplement` extends the existing archive via SM; a fresh question wipes everything and returns to Discovery. |

## Component map

C4 Container view. Deployment boundaries as containers; modules inside; arrows are asymmetric calls (a typed contract crosses every arrow — either a Zod schema boundary or a VS Code API).

The webview never talks to the engine directly. **Map** (engine, deterministic) — agenda, visited set, neighbour metadata, consent gates, route / column validation. **Router** (AI, semantic) — read focus DDL, write `sections[]` (one entry per fired `*_capture` template — classification-locked: 1 for `business`/`technical`, 2 for `both`) + summary, emit verdict, issue `route_requests`. The two sides couple through exactly two calls: `getHopContext` downstream, `submit_findings` upstream.

## Bipartite analysis model

The engine treats the lineage graph as bipartite: only **bodied** nodes (views, procedures, functions with a body) carry logic the AI can analyse. Tables have structure but no body — they are pipes, not work.

- **Agenda** — bodied nodes only. Each hop analyses one body.
- **Scope** — every reachable node, including tables. Tables remain routable, referenceable, and inspectable via `get_neighbor_columns`.
- **Edge contraction** — when a bodied node routes to a table, the authored question flows *through* the table to the table's bodied neighbours.

```mermaid
graph LR
    SP([sp — procedure])
    T[table — passive pipe]
    VA([viewA — view])
    VB([viewB — view])
    SP -->|route_request<br/>question forwarded| T
    T -.->|edge contraction| VA
    T -.->|edge contraction| VB
```

Rounded boxes are bodied (agenda-eligible); the square box is the passive table. Dashed arrows are the contraction path — the AI never sees a "table hop". The invariant is enforced by a single funnel in [`src/ai/smBase.ts`](../src/ai/smBase.ts): `enqueueHop` is the only code path that writes to the agenda.

**Origin exception.** When the user starts a trace at a non-bodied node (typically a table), `enqueueHop` lifts the contraction *for the origin push only*: the starting point gets its own agenda slot and runs the standard `business_capture` / `technical_capture` templates. Middle-graph tables remain contracted.

## Tools per phase

[`src/ai/toolPolicy.ts`](../src/ai/toolPolicy.ts) is the single source of truth. The narrow ACTIVE palette is what keeps `toolMode.Required` effective: providers may downgrade `Required` to `Auto` when more than one tool is visible.

| Tool | Discovery | ACTIVE inline BB | ACTIVE SM (BB+CT) | Synthesis | Completed | Purpose |
|------|:---------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|:---------:|---------|
| `get_context` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | Schemas, stats, active filter |
| `search_objects` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | Resolve name / column → ID |
| `search_ddl` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | Regex over SP / view / function bodies |
| `get_object_detail` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | Full metadata + DDL + neighbours for one object |
| `get_neighbor_columns` | — | — | ✓ | — | — | Columns + types + FKs for direct neighbours (no DDL); used for prune decisions |
| `detect_graph_patterns` | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | Hubs / orphans / cycles / islands / longest-path / external-refs |
| `start_exploration` | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ (supplement) | Hand off to the state machine |
| `submit_findings` | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | Submit hop analysis + route + prune. Required mode. |
| `present_result` | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | Author the final report (sections, summary, highlights) |

## Class D / Class S routing contract

- **Class D — Direct.** One named object in isolation OR graph-wide metadata. Answered directly via chat using discovery tools. Never used to narrate "flow", "lineage", or "join path" across multiple neighbours.
- **Class S — State machine.** Analysis or visualisation of relationships spanning ≥ 2 connected objects. Routes to `start_exploration`. Any "lineage graph", "annotated trace", or "explain the joins / pipeline" request must use Class S.
- **Tiebreaker.** Prefer Class S when ambiguous.

## Inline vs SM execution

| Dimension | Inline mode | SM (sliding-memory) mode |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Trigger** | Scope ≤ `inlineNodeCap` AND ≤ `inlineTokenBudget`, no column tracing | Scope exceeds either threshold, or column tracing active |
| **Context** | Full DDL + columns for ALL scope nodes shipped at once | Focus DDL + sliding window of last 3 node summaries |
| **History** | Not wiped | Wiped every hop |
| **Termination** | AI sets `complete: true` | Engine drains agenda; `complete: true` silently ignored |
| **Mid-session out-of-scope route** | Engine emits `action_required` consent gate | Engine `deferQuestion(...)`; surfaced at synthesis |

True Inline runs Blackboard only; any session with a Column Aspect is forced to SM regardless of scope size.

## Memory model

There is exactly **one** persistent store — the **Detail Archive** (`detailSlots`, append-only across the session). Each hop the prompt builder assembles fresh **Working Memory (WM)** by selectively projecting from the archive plus a few constants — there is no second mutable store and nothing is "wiped". Two diagrams: (1) what WM looks like and where each field comes from; (2) how the archive grows across hops and what the sliding window reads back.

**WM composition (one hop).** Cylinder = persistent datastore (UML); rounded box = projection / derived view; rectangle = constant.

```mermaid

    classDef wm stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray:4 2
    classDef prompt stroke:#0288d1,stroke-width:2px
```

The dashed orange WM boxes are not stored anywhere — they are computed on demand by `getWorkingMemory()` and `getShortTermMemory()`, then serialised into the prompt. The next hop rebuilds WM from the *now-larger* archive. This is what makes the loop bounded: WM stays small even as the archive grows.

**Archive growth across hops.** Each successful `submit_findings` appends one `DetailSlot` to the archive. The sliding window every hop reads is `archive.slice(-3)` — so as the archive grows, the *content* of `short_term_memory` slides forward.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    classDef synth stroke:#6a1b9a,stroke-width:2px
```

The dotted reverse arrows are **reads back from the archive into the next hop's prompt**. The window stays at 3 entries — past hop 3 the oldest summary slides off. Only at synthesis does the *full* archive get lifted (double arrow), regardless of length.

**Detail Archive** — `AiMemoryManager.detailSlots`. Per-node sections (one entry per fired `*_capture` template, classification-locked: business → 1, technical → 1, both → 2), written via `submit_findings.sections[]`. Never compressed, never shipped mid-loop. Lifted verbatim as peer entries in `present_result.sections[]` at synthesis only.

**WM fields.** Three accessors on `AiMemoryManager` produce the inputs the prompt builder needs each hop:

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `user_question` | constant (set at session start) | Root question echoed verbatim every hop so it survives the per-hop prompt rebuild. |
| `checklist` | `getWorkingMemory()` — derived from `detailSlots.size` and scope | `{ current_hop, noted, total, open, coveragePct, rounds_used, scope_growth }` — drain signal so the AI knows agenda progress. |
| `recent_rejections` | `getWorkingMemory()` | Recent route validation failures — feedback channel without re-injecting full errors. |
| `active_schemas` | `getWorkingMemory()` | Schema filter still in effect this hop. |
| `budget_pressure` | `getWorkingMemory()` (optional) | `'tight'` or `'exceeded'` — surfaced when the engine wants the AI to wind down. |
| `short_term_memory` | `getShortTermMemory()` — `detailSlots.values().slice(-3)` | Sliding window of the last three node summaries, injected as the `<short_term_memory>` XML block in the system prompt. **This is the "iteratively growing" view of the archive.** |
| `column_aspect` | column tracker (CT mode only) | `{ target_columns, done_columns, active_columns }` — present only when the session is tracing specific columns. |

None of these WM fields are stored — they are computed from the archive (or the constants) every hop. Global engine state (agenda, visited set, pending questions) is intentionally excluded from this payload; that's what keeps each hop's input bounded even on a long trace.

## The hop payload

`NavigationEngine.getHopContext()` returns one JSON object per hop, delivered as the tool result. It is self-contained — the AI does not need conversation history to reason about the current hop.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `sm_status` | `'awaiting_findings'` while draining — explicit "you are mid-loop" signal that survives sliding wipes |
| `hop` | 1-based hop number |
| `agenda_remaining` | Nodes still on the agenda |
| `focus_node` | `{id, schema, name, type, ddl, columns, fks}` for the current node |
| `neighbors[]` | Each entry: `{id, schema, name, type, edge_direction, edge_type, boundary, cols, fks, hasDdl}` |
| `current_task` | Sub-question driving *this* hop (set by `route_requests` from a prior hop, or the root question on hop 1) |
| `contract_ref` | Hash pointer to the immutable `ScopeContract` for this session — the AI reads `origin / direction / depth / classification / filters / nlInterpretation` from the contract instead of re-stating them per hop |
| `working_memory.short_term_memory` | Sliding window of the last 3 node summaries the AI authored |
| `working_memory.checklist` | Drain progress |
| `working_memory.recent_rejections` | Recent route-validation failures |

Fields that used to live in `working_memory` (`user_question`, `active_schemas`, `topological_map`, `depth_budget`, `depth_cap`, `approved_border`) are no longer duplicated in the payload — they are pinned in the `ScopeContract` for the session and re-read by `contract_ref`. This eliminates the markdown↔JSON duplication where the same focus / hop / agenda / scope facts rode along once as `<mission_state>` markdown and again as JSON.

## The hop envelope (system prompt builder)

`buildHopEnvelope({ phase, focusType, contract, lastToolResultPresent })` in [`src/ai/hopEnvelope.ts`](../src/ai/hopEnvelope.ts) returns the system prompt as three explicit bands:

```
[ ANCHOR ]   role + platform + ScopeContract.brief + tool contract
             — IMMUTABLE for the session, prefix-stable for prompt-cache hits
             — mission brief lives HERE (not buried below doctrine)

[ DOCTRINE ] phase-specific rules + verdict protocol +
             ONE capture template selected by (phase, classification, focusType, ctMode)
             — STABLE per axis tuple; cacheable
             — un-fired template body never reaches the model

[ STATE ]    current_task block + last_action_outcome digest
             — VARIABLE per hop; minimal; NEVER restates contract
             — <mission_state> markdown SKIPPED when lastResult JSON present
               (the carried tool result already has focus_node.id, hop, agenda)
             — short_term_memory stays (per-node summaries the AI authored;
               not duplicated by lastResult JSON)
```

Cache key is `(phase, focusType)` — anchor is byte-stable across hops within a session; doctrine is byte-stable within (phase, focusType). One cache miss per (phase, focusType) transition is correct, not a regression — a procedure hop and a table hop carry different doctrine.

## Completion contract

| Mode | Trigger | What happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Inline | AI sets `complete: true` on `submit_findings` | Tool returns `{ ok: true, done: true, result }`; AI produces chat answer + `present_result` |
| SM | Engine drains the agenda — every item gets `analyze`, `pass`, or `prune` | Engine emits the synthesis trigger; AI produces chat answer + `present_result`. `complete: true` is silently ignored. |
| MAX_ROUNDS cap | `ai.maxRounds` reached without completion | Partial archive discarded (`sess.memory.reset()`); actionable rerun message rendered. **All-or-nothing by design** — missing nodes can invert the picture. |

Three verdicts (SM mode):

- `analyze` — full analysis stored; drives badges and notes.
- `pass` — visited, no analysis stored. Intended for variant siblings of an already-analysed archetype.
- `prune` — cascade-prune the node + its unreachable downstream. Rejected by the orphan guard if it would disconnect an already-analysed node; fall back to `pass`.

The orphan guard (`wouldOrphanNotedNode`) is content-blind. Engine guards are topological only — content judgement lives in the AI and the prompts that frame it.

## Mechanical enforcement

The ACTIVE phase sets `vscode.LanguageModelChatToolMode.Required` on every `sendRequest`. The AI cannot emit free-form text during the hop loop — it must call `submit_findings`.

- **Speed via verbs, not adjectives.** `verdict: "prune"` drains the agenda quickly → synthesis fires. No silent text bail.
- **ACTIVE tool palette is narrow** — `submit_findings` only in inline BB; `+ get_neighbor_columns` in SM. Multi-tool would force `Required` to downgrade to `Auto` on some providers.
- **Repeat-Reject Guard** — [`src/ai/repeatRejectGuard.ts`](../src/ai/repeatRejectGuard.ts). Aborts the session cleanly if the same tool call fails three consecutive times. Surfaces via `HopLoopExit.aborted` with `{ error: 'session_aborted_repeat_reject' }`.
- **Termination authority** stays with the engine in SM. The engine emits the synthesis trigger after the last verdict; the AI never decides "we're done here".
- **Classification mandatory at gate-emit.** `start_exploration` Zod schema requires `classification: z.enum(['business','technical','both'])` (no `.optional()`, no `.default()`). `sess.classification` is non-nullable from gate-approve onward. The legacy "undefined → all gates pass" fallback in the template renderer is removed.
- **Multi-axis capture-template gate** — `TEMPLATE_GATE` on `(phase, classification, focusType, ctMode)` in [`templateRenderer.ts`](../src/ai/templateRenderer.ts). Each active-phase capture template declares which axes it applies to; the renderer ships exactly the templates whose every axis matches the current session. No body for an un-fired axis tuple ever reaches the model. Replaces the legacy classification-only `CLASSIFICATION_GATED` map.
- **NL-filter contract** — `start_exploration` rejects `nl_filter_overgeneralized` when the user's prompt names specific identifiers AND the AI passed `excludeTypes`. Forces the named list onto `excludeNodeIds`. Surfaces the parsed identifiers in the gate detail's "How I read your prompt" banner so the user catches over-exclusion before approval.
- **Gate detail always rendered** — when the session is `awaiting_gate` at finalizer time, `dispatchExit` rebuilds the detail from `engine.getScopeContract()` if no `gate`-exit fired this turn. Refine narration ("I'll remove the views…") with no tool call still shows the current scope tree above the buttons.
- **Synthesis pre-tool prose is shape-bounded.** `LanguageModelChatToolMode.Required` for `present_result` forces the synthesis turn into the shape "(optional ≤1 paragraph prose) → tool call → structured report". Streamer surfaces pre-tool prose as a chat summary; the legacy `## ` heading-slice that dropped legitimate one-line summaries is gone.

## Known failure modes

These are observed in production logs; the mitigations are real code paths, not hypothetical.

| Mode | Symptom | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Parallel `start_exploration` storm** | After a `complete_rejected`, the AI emits N parallel `start_exploration` calls (one per unvisited neighbour) and wipes the accumulated archive. | Hard guard in `toolProvider.ts`: rejects calls 2..N within one LM round with `{error:'parallel_call_forbidden', hint}`. Prose hints alone are not binding. |
| **DDL overflow** | One hop returns a 50K-char tool result (verbose log SP) and the next hop's input jumps from ~7K to ~17K tokens. | Full DDL is shipped per hop (no truncation, no refetch — simpler contract). On a > 500K-char mega-proc the provider's token limit surfaces naturally; the user prunes via `prune_neighbors` or refines the start scope. |
| **Synthesis on empty archive** | Final round receives the synthesis prompt but no archive slots — output is truncated with no `present_result`. | Detect empty-archive synthesis and emit a user-facing warning + re-run suggestion. |

## State diagram — navigation engine

Two zoom levels. The top-level FSM shows phase transitions; the Analysis loop is the only phase with non-trivial internal mechanics, so it gets its own focused view.

**Top-level phases.** Cross-phase transitions only — sub-states are documented in their respective sections above.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Discovery
    Discovery --> Discovery: Class D direct answer
    Discovery --> Analysis: Class S — start_exploration
    Analysis --> Synthesis: agenda drained
    Synthesis --> Completed: present_result
    Completed --> Analysis: supplement / extend scope
    Completed --> Synthesis: re-render only
    Completed --> Discovery: fresh question
```

**Analysis hop loop.** Inside the Analysis phase, every hop runs this cycle until the agenda is empty.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> EvaluateAgenda
    EvaluateAgenda --> FetchContext: pop next
    FetchContext --> AI_Reasoning: ship map + DDL
    AI_Reasoning --> ValidateSubmission: submit_findings
    ValidateSubmission --> UpdateMemory: ok
    ValidateSubmission --> AI_Reasoning: rejected (fail-early retry)
    UpdateMemory --> EvaluateAgenda
    EvaluateAgenda --> [*]: agenda empty → Synthesis
```

Discovery sub-states (`ClassifyQuestion → ClassD | ClassS → SeedAgenda`) and Synthesis sub-states (`AggregateFindings → GenerateReport → PresentResult`) are linear and are documented inline in those phase descriptions. The Completed phase branches on the user's follow-up action — see the cross-phase transitions above.

## Session FSM & typed exit dispatch

`SessionPhase` ([`src/ai/sessionPhase.ts`](../src/ai/sessionPhase.ts)) is a typed discriminated union; every hop-loop exit is typed; one `dispatchExit` switch owns all post-loop cleanup. TypeScript exhaustiveness prevents "paused gate rendered as incomplete" regressions structurally.

| `HopLoopExit.kind` | Triggered by | Cleanup |
|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| `final_answer` | AI produced chat response with no tool calls (SM complete or discovery final) | `sess.enterIdle()` + optional "Show in Graph" button |
| `gate` | Tool result carried `action_required` envelope (Zod-validated) | `sess.enterGate(gate)` + stream consent question. No partial storage. |
| `hop_cap` | `MAX_ROUNDS` reached | `sess.memory.reset()` + `sess.enterIdle()` + actionable rerun notice |
| `aborted` | Repeat-reject guard | `storeBbResultPartial()` if slots exist + `sess.enterIdle()` |
| `error` | Uncaught exception | `sess.enterIdle()` + error message |

## Singleton session model

One `AiSession` per extension instance.

- **Cross-session guard** — each `start_exploration` stamps `engine.sessionId = sess.id`. A new call from a different session ID wipes the prior SM silently and queues a one-line notice. No blocking dialogs.
- **Same-session re-call is a hard error**, not a wipe. Returns `{ error: 'already_started', hint }`.
- **Auto-reset** after 30 min of inactivity (`STALE_AFTER_MS`) or immediately when the prior SM has reached `complete`.
- **Result-graph preservation** — when VS Code creates an empty-history thread and the session has a `resultGraph` ≤ 5 min old, the graph survives the reset so follow-up prompts like *"show the trace result in the graph"* still render.

## Scope-budget enforcement

Two complementary guards keep the loop inside the user's declared scope:

1. **Preflight gate** — at `start_exploration`, SM sessions whose initial BFS scope exceeds `ai.maxRounds × 0.7` are rejected with `scope_exceeds_budget`. The AI receives a `safe_depth_hint` and asks the user to narrow the question.
2. **Per-hop consent gate** — during ACTIVE, any route leaving the schema filter or exceeding the depth cap returns an `action_required` envelope. Inline mode pauses for yes/no; SM mode silently defers (deferred questions surface at synthesis).

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Map** | Deterministic state owned by `NavigationEngine`: agenda, visited set, neighbour metadata, gates. |
| **Router** | Semantic decisions made by the AI: sub-question, verdict, route requests, prune judgements. |
| **Class D** | Direct answer via discovery tools — one isolated object or graph-wide metadata. No "flow" narration. |
| **Class S** | State-machine exploration via `start_exploration` — anything spanning ≥ 2 connected objects. |
| **BB** (Blackboard) | Default nav mode. Used when no target columns are specified. |
| **CT** (Column Trace) | Nav mode activated when `targetColumns` are set. Adds column validation + `column_flow` attribution. |
| **Inline mode** | One-shot execution for scopes within `inlineNodeCap` and `inlineTokenBudget`. AI may self-terminate. |
| **SM mode** | Hop-by-hop execution for larger scopes. Memory wiped each hop; engine owns termination. |
| **Bodied node** | View / procedure / function. Only these enter the agenda as hop focuses. |
| **Edge contraction** | Routing through a table forwards the question to the table's bodied neighbours. |
| **Detail Archive** | Per-node full `analysis` text, written each hop, shipped only at synthesis. |
| **Working Memory** (WM) | Per-hop snapshot the prompt builder assembles from the archive plus constants — `user_question`, `checklist`, `recent_rejections`, `active_schemas`, optional `budget_pressure`; `short_term_memory` (last 3 summaries) is a sibling sliding view from `getShortTermMemory()`. Not stored — recomputed every hop. |
| **`action_required`** | Engine envelope that emits a consent gate. Turn ends; user reply resumes or aborts. |
| **Deferred question** | In SM, an out-of-border route collected silently and surfaced at synthesis. |
